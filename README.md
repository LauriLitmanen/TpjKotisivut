# TPJ Homepage
https://www.tpj.fi

Homepage for TPJ Counter-strike team. 
# Motivation
This website is my first actual live website and its an ongoing project. I wanted to learn web development and decided to make a homepage for our CSGO team. 
Its a static website built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as project builder. 
The website changes a lot because I use it as a playground to test new things.
# TPJ Match App
The website is connected to my other project named [TPJ Flask App](https://github.com/LauriLitmanen/flask_match_app). The upcoming and results list are built by using JSON data from the Match App.
